# 🧼 Cafe Sales Data Cleaning & Analysis Project

This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a messy cafe sales dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to:

- Clean and prepare raw sales data for analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends and insights using visual tools

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **Seaborn** – advanced statistical plots
- **Google Colab** – notebook environment
- **Git & GitHub** – version control

---

## 🔄 Data Cleaning Steps

- 🧠 **Handled Data Types**: 
  - Converted `transaction_date` to proper `datetime` format for time-based analysis.
  - Converted `quantity`, `price_per_unit`, and `total_spent` columns to numeric types to enable accurate calculations.
- 🚫 **Handled Missing Values**: Identified and treated missing values by imputing them as appropriate.
- 🧹 **Standardized Column Names**: Cleaned and renamed columns for consistency and readability.
- 📅 **Created New Column – `month`**: Extracted the `YYYY-MM` format from `transaction_date` to create a `month` column, making monthly aggregation easier.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-  **Visualized total sales on a daily and monthly basis using line plots to understand overall sales performance.**
-  **dentified top-performing products through bar charts, highlighting items that contribute the most to revenue.**
